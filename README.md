# :100: WASMffmpeg and React clipping tool

WIP tool to trim video clips and export them. I dont actually know anything about ffmpeg but I guess this will be a learning experience

planned functionality:

 - Import multiple clips [x]
 - Playback single working clip [x]
 - trim start and end points [ ]
 - audio tracks with volume control [ ] (I am not sure if this is currently possible)
 
 if you wish to try the app, use the usual npm commands
 ```
 npm install
 npm start run
 ```
