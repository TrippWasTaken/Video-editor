# :100: WASMffmpeg and React clipping tool

WIP tool to trim video clips and export them. I dont actually know anything about ffmpeg but I guess this will be a learning experience

planned functionality:

 - Import multiple clips
 - trim start and end points
 - audio tracks with volume control
 
 if you wish to try the app, use the usual npm commands
 ```
 npm install
 npm start run
 ```
